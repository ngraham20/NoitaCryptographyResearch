## What We Know
There are 9 messages hidden in the two direct parallel worlds *East 1* and *West 1*. For every message location in the East Parallel, there is an equivalent message in the same location in the West Parallel, save for East 5, noted below.
- East 1
- West 1
- East 2
- West 2
- East 3
- West 3
- East 4
- West 4
- East 5

Notice that there is no West 5. The reason for this is unknown, however it is speculated that the location where West 5 would be may be either a trigger location or an event location that triggers when the puzzle is solved.
