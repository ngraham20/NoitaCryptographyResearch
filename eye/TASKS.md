# TASKS

- DONE convert to python
- TODO brute force trigram rotations and count unique trigrams (dictionary)
- INFO https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_(Unicode_block) : there are 88 total runic unicode characters, 5 of which are... "extra". This leaves 83, which happens to be the fewest possible trigram count. If nothing else, I find runic easier to look at than random symbols and letters.
- TODO set up the mayan calender cipher
- DONE see if atomic numbers do anything, such as 1=H for Hydrogen, etc. Actually, this would only be substitution and doesn't make a difference.
- INFO The fact that there are 83 unique and sequential trigrams, 0-82 and 82 is the atomic number of Lead is a little fishy to me. On top of this, the atomic number for gold is 79. There are 39 eyes in a row, and 79+39=118, the total number of elements in the table. I wonder if there's a cipher that would simply have lead->gold as the primary action for the cipher.
- INFO https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_Manuscripts
- DONE each module should handle their own arguments, main loop iterates modules
- DONE implement a path option that can handle taking plaintext and sending it through multiple encryptions.
- TODO implement chi squared analysis of a single message
- TODO add a flag for analyzing every message and analyzing each message
- TODO implement genetic algorithms to guess wheel orientations
