TODO brute force trigram rotations and count unique trigrams (dictionary)
INFO https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_(Unicode_block) : there are 88 total runic unicode characters, 5 of which are... "extra". This leaves 83, which happens to be the fewest possible trigram count. If nothing else, I find runic easier to look at than random symbols and letters.
